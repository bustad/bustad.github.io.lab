Something that I find immensely fascinating is music. What exactly is it? How does it work? Why do some musical passages have such an emotional impact? What is the mathematical basis of which notes fit together and of which chords work together? If history would have started over, would we have music similar to what we have today or could it have been something completely different? Which aspects of music do we learn and which are we born with, i.e. nature versus nurture?

Learning the theory of music is possible through video lectures on YouTube, through university courses, by analyzing musical passages and in many other ways. Below are the best ways I have found so far of learning music theory.

# Video lectures on YouTube

The best video lectures that I have found so far on YouTube are the ones by [Christopher Brellochs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw9t0oA3fHkxx1PgYpiXrMUPXaOiwh6KU) and the ones by [Seth Monahan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6X9nEsddMpYNyxr3ZckjLg/videos?view=0&sort=da).

There are many other channels on YouTube that teach music theory, but mostly in slightly shorter videos and not as much in a classical lecture style.

LECTURES HERE!

These are my favourites at the moment, but there are also many more, and I am sure that I have not discovered all of them yet.
