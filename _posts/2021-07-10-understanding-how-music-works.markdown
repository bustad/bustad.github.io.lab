Something that I find immensely fascinating is music. What exactly is it? How does it work? Why do some musical passages have such an emotional impact? What is the mathematical basis of which notes fit together and of which chords work together? If history would have started over, would we have music similar to what we have today or could it have been something completely different? Which aspects of music do we learn and which are we born with, i.e. nature versus nurture?
